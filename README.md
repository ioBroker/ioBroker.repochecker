# Adapter repository checker
This is a code for frontend and back-end of the service https://adapter-check.iobroker.in/

If you want to add your adapter to the public ioBroker repository, all tests on this page must be OK.

## How to test via cli
You can pass your repository as a parameter to test

``npx @iobroker/repochecker <repo> [branch]``

```
npx @iobroker/repochecker https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.javascript master
```

Branch (`master/main/dev`) is optional.
